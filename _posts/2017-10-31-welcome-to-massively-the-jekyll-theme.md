This is the introductory episode of A Side Of Data podcast that aims to introduce the listener to the soul of the later episodes. This podcast is all about using data to bring real value and insights through data science, process mining, data visualization algorithms, and going beyond data, to make more sense by the conceptual modeling, BPM, etc. Welcome to the podcast!

Thank you Danial Foroughi for creating an amazing podcast intro

Just go ahead and read up on [how to install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It's not too hard I promise!

Download this repository [here](https://github.com/iwiedenm/jekyll-theme-massively) and save it to any folder you want.

Open a terminal window or a command line and ```cd``` to that location.

Then enter: ```bundle exec jekyll serve```. You can now access your new Jekyll site from [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/). Have fun exploring your new site!
